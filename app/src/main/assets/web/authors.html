			<p class = "content-padded uppercase">
				Preamble
			</p>
			<p class = "content-padded">
				The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate
				worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support
				the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic
				communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which
				fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
			</p>
			<p class = "content-padded">
				The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified
				and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by
				themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
				bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software
				provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative
				works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released
				under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to
				remain under this license does not apply to any document created
				using the fonts or their derivatives.

				changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
				environment.
